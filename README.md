# Text-Learning-Enron
Program that gets over ten thousand emails as its input, cleans the text data using NLTK and classifies it by its author
The data and initial codes were retreived from Udacity's Machine Learning course
The changes have been done by me to make the code look cleaner and produce the desired output
Due to the size of data, parsing it for each execution would be troublesome, so I have pickled them in a file which can be used as an input
